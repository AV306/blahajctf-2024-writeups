# Scan Me

Reconstruct the qr code pixel by pixel.

Stare at it until you start seeing dinosaurs and ducks in the whitespace.

Count rows and columns until you forget how numbers work.

Then scan it and profit.

I spent way, way, *way* too much time on this one. The uneven row/column width made it
fairly hard, but the neat part is that QR error correction is very pog and can let you stop early!
